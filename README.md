# parsec.vim

This is a vim version of the
[parsec](https://github.com/Keithbsmiley/parsec) colorscheme. This is
built using
[color-builder](https://github.com/Keithbsmiley/color-builder). If
you're not interested in clicking either of those links that means it
is based on the [solarized vim
template](https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized) using
different colors. This repo is separate for slim inclusion as
explained below.
